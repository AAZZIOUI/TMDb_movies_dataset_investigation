# TMDb Movies dataset investigation ( first udacity project)
## by (Anas Azzioui)

## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier


## Dataset:

Link: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
    - Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
    - There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
    - The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.


## Takeaways:
After completing the project, I will:

    - Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process 
    - Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
    - Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
    - Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
    - Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
    - Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
    - Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
